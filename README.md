These codes are what are learned from javascript from JONAS 
and in the forkify app I tested https://spoonacular.com/ 
api because food2fork didn't work and so it has some changes 
I really appreciate my dear teacher JONAS SCHMEDTMANN.

Future work: After taking the complete course of html,css 
I want to make the forkify app html & css better and if 
there is a bug in the app please contact me: maryam.kh1374@gmail.com
