These codes are what are learned from javascript from JONAS 
and in the forkify app I tested https://spoonacular.com/ 
api because food2fork didn't work and so it has some changes 
I really appreciate my dear teacher JONAS SCHMEDTMANN.

Note: my codes are in the starter folders for example 
9-forkify/starter and in the import_export_exercise I wrote 
an important_Note.txt that step by step and completely 
explains how to use webpack, babel in your project :)

Future work: After taking the complete course of html,css 
I want to make the forkify app html & css better.
